# Interactive Markdown Rendering Framework

Welcome to **IMRF** - the next generation framework for transforming static Markdown content into interactive, modular, and highly customizable web documentation.

## What is IMRF?

IMRF addresses the fragmentation of Markdown files in modern repositories by providing a unified rendering system that maintains GitHub compatibility while enabling advanced navigation, interactivity, and customization features.
